# factor-performance-analysis

A small practice project exploring basic diagnostics of equity factor behavior using historical data.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a practice-oriented exploratory analysis of common equity factors.  
The goal of the project is not to develop trading strategies or to establish persistent predictive relationships, but to gain hands-on familiarity with standard tools used to examine factor behavior.

The analysis focuses on descriptive and diagnostic perspectives, including return aggregation, simple predictive diagnostics, and structural exposure inspection.

---

## Data

The project uses monthly factor return data from the Kenneth R. French Data Library.

- Frequency: Monthly
- Factors considered: Market (Mkt-RF), SMB, HML
- Sample start: 2000

All returns are converted from percentages to decimal form prior to analysis.

## Analyses Performed

The following exploratory analyses are conducted:

1. **Cumulative return visualization**  
   Factor returns are compounded to illustrate long-term performance paths and to provide basic context for subsequent diagnostics.

2. **Information Coefficient (IC) exploration**  
   Simple Spearman rank correlations are computed between factor values and future market returns across multiple forecast horizons, as an illustrative measure of short-horizon predictive behavior.

3. **Sector exposure inspection**  
   Asset-level weights are aggregated by sector to examine whether observed factor behavior may be associated with underlying industry concentration.

These analyses are intended as diagnostic tools rather than formal statistical tests.

---

## Observations

Several qualitative patterns emerge from the exploratory results:

- Cumulative return paths differ substantially across factors, with notable regime-dependent behavior.
- IC values fluctuate across prediction horizons and tend to weaken at longer horizons.
- Sector aggregation suggests that factor behavior may partially reflect industry exposure rather than isolated factor effects.

These observations are descriptive and sample-specific, and are not interpreted as evidence of stable or exploitable factor premia.

## Scope and Limitations

- The project is illustrative and exploratory in nature.
- No transaction costs, portfolio construction, or performance optimization is considered.
- Results depend on the chosen data sample and analysis setup.
- No claims are made regarding out-of-sample predictability or investment applicability.

## Notes

This project is intended as a learning exercise focused on understanding commonly used factor diagnostics and their limitations, rather than as a research or trading study.
